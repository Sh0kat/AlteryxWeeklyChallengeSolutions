# Challenge 128:

A group of friends are playing their favorite game. Not being a bunch of data analysts and understanding the importance of inputting data in an easy to work with way, they devised an incredibly inefficient way to keep score of their game! In the game, there is 5 rounds of play and 5 players (a,b,c,d,e - first letter of their names). For each lowercase letter under their initial, 1 point is awarded. For each uppercase letter, 1 point is subtracted from their overall score. As the only right and fair arbiter, they call you in to use Alteryx to figure out each players score for each round and their respective totals. Who won?

# Challenge 129:
You are hosting a lunch event and you have 5 possible locations. Your task is to choose the location that minimizes the overall cost (accounting for the benefit) to the company and report the cost.

Assumptions
- A person will only come if the location is under 10 miles from their location.
- The benefit of a person coming to the event is $20.
- The cost of a "missed opportunity" (people you must turn away after capacity is reached) is $5. Note that this only applies to those under 10 miles from the location.

Data
Locations: the 5 potential locations, the fixed price, and the capacity
Customers: the location of your customers and the count of employees that would come to your event

# Challenge 130:

You have a source system that doesn't seem to be working quite as expected. The system will frequently take any given word and duplicate it within a string. You job is to clean it up! Below we have a few sample phrases that are indicative of the system's problem. Find all words that have duplicate consecutive words and reduce the duplication to a single word again! 

# Challenge 131:

“Think like a CSE” series. 
The Case: A co-worker is running into the R error “Append Cluster: Error: cannot allocate vector of size 7531.1 Gb“ in a workflow that uses a couple of the Predictive Clustering Tools. This error is causing the workflow to stop running before completing.
Your Goal: Identify the root cause of the issue, and develop a solution or workaround to help your co-worker get past this error and finish running the workflow. 
Asset Description: Your co-worker can’t share the file with you due to client privacy concerns, but it is about 7 GB in size (3 million records and 30 fields). Using only the provided screenshots, dummy data of your own design, and sheer willpower, can you develop a possible resolution?

# Challenge 132:


Happy 3rd Anniversary Community! It has been a wild and crazy three years. Now let's see what the future of Community looks like. In the workflow, the data represents the number of posts posted on a monthly basis. Note that the first record contains a count of posts before 2017-01-01 and each record thereafter represents a month between 2017-01-01 and 2018-08-01. Your job is to forecast (ARIMA) in what future month Community will surpass the 1 Million post milestone using the high end of the 80% confidence interval (because we are optimists). Sound off what you got!

# Challenge 133:

NASA Lab Location Analysis
Researchers need to understand which NASA research facility is most optimally located. Specifically, which facility has the most other facilities within 200 miles. Once that facility is determined, they want to create a polygon that bounds the spatial points of the facility and the other facilities within 200 miles.

# Challenge 134:

You have been tasked with finding the amount of days that elapsed from one email to another. Please provide the amount of days between emails (without regard for time) in chronological order according to the data in the "Date:" record for each email.
